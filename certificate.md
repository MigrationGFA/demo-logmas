## 2. In-Depth Component & File Descriptions

### A. Coordinate & Field Configuration
- **`src/config/certificateFieldConfig.ts`**  
  The primary configuration engine. Defines two complete master templates: `PORTRAIT_TEMPLATE_CONFIG` and `LANDSCAPE_TEMPLATE_CONFIG`. Specifies exact x/y percentage coordinates, bounding boxes (`width`, `height`), text alignments, container-query font sizes (`cqw`), font families, font weights, colors, and dynamic formatters for every field (e.g. LGA title, certificate number, citizen name, ward, date of issuance, and QR code placement).
- **`src/config/certificateTemplates.ts`**  
  Provides alternative and extended coordinate sets (`ODEDA_CERTIFICATE_TEMPLATES`), detailed layout metadata, boundary calibrations, and fallback configurations for Club Registrations and State of Origin certificates.
- **`src/config/certificateTemplateMap.ts`**  
  The routing bridge between statutory services and visual templates. Maps service codes (such as `LG-COO-01`, `LG-CR-01`, `LG-BL-01`) to either `portrait` or `landscape`, defining display titles, categories, and orientation settings.

---

### B. Core Certificate Rendering Engine
- **`src/components/certificate/CertificateRenderer.tsx`**  
  The core rendering canvas. It mounts the official master artwork as an exact-fit background layer (`img`), creates a CSS container query context (`container-type: inline-size`), and renders each data field as an absolutely positioned element based on the percentage coordinates from `certificateFieldConfig.ts`. It also handles cryptographic QR code placement and print color adjustments.
- **`src/components/certificate/CertificateViewer.tsx`**  
  The top-level interactive viewer for certificate display. Features a sticky toolbar with template layout switching (Portrait vs. Landscape), zoom adjustments (70%–130%), one-click link sharing, public verification routing, and twin print/download actions (**"Download PDF"** and **"Print Official"**) with specialized `@media print` CSS rules.
- **`src/components/certificate/CertificateCanvas.tsx`**  
  A lightweight helper component that wraps `CertificateRenderer` and automatically looks up the service code in `certificateTemplateMap.ts` if no custom config is passed.

---

### C. Template Wrappers
- **`src/components/certificate/templates/CertificateOfOriginTemplate.tsx`**  
  A specialized wrapper that binds a `PublicCertificate` object directly to `PORTRAIT_TEMPLATE_CONFIG` for Indigene, Origin, and single-sheet statutory certificates.
- **`src/components/certificate/templates/ClubRegistrationTemplate.tsx`**  
  A specialized wrapper that binds a `PublicCertificate` object to `LANDSCAPE_TEMPLATE_CONFIG` for Clubs, Societies, NGOs, and Association Registrations.

---

### D. Shared Security & Dynamic Elements
- **`src/components/certificate/shared/CertificateQRCode.tsx`**  
  Renders an SVG QR code pointing to the public verification endpoint, decorated with corner security brackets for tamper-evident validation. Remains fully dynamic.
- **`src/components/certificate/shared/CertificateSignature.tsx`**  
  Renders authentic executive calligraphy signatures using script typography (`Pinyon Script` / `Great Vibes`), sign-off rules, dates, and official government titles.
*(Note: Static seals, guilloche borders, watermarks, and national/LGA emblems were baked directly into the master artwork `origin-template.jpg` and `club-registration-template.jpg`, allowing removal of redundant code components `CertificateSeal.tsx`, `CertificateEmblems.tsx`, `CertificateWatermark.tsx`, and `GuillocheBorder.tsx`.)*

---

### E. Fonts & Print CSS Definitions
- **`src/app/globals.css`**  
  Imports Google Web Fonts used across certificate typography:
  - **`Cinzel`**: Used for authoritative titles, headings, and state headers.
  - **`EB Garamond`**: Classical serif used for legal certification statements.
  - **`Pinyon Script` & `Great Vibes`**: Calligraphic fonts used for executive signatures.
  - **`Arimo` & `Playfair Display`**: Clean body and secondary display typography.  
  Also configures strict `@media print` rules (`-webkit-print-color-adjust: exact`, `@page` margins, toolbar hiding) for pixel-perfect PDF export.
- **`src/app/layout.tsx`**  
  Injects Geist Sans and Geist Mono variable fonts at the root HTML layout level.

---

### F. Master Background Artwork (Public Assets)
- **`public/certificates/templates/origin-template.jpg`** (353 KB)  
  High-resolution portrait master background containing pre-printed borders, state headers, and seals for State of Origin certificates.
- **`public/certificates/templates/club-registration-template.jpg`** (356 KB)  
  High-resolution landscape master background containing pre-printed frames for Club & Association Registration certificates.
- **`public/certificates/templates/receipt-template.jpg`** (514 KB)  
  High-resolution background for statutory revenue collection receipts.

---

### G. Public & Dashboard Routes
- **`src/app/certificate/page.tsx`**  
  Public certificate portal where citizens or third parties can input a certificate number or verification code to look up a document.
- **`src/app/certificate/[...token]/page.tsx`**  
  Public catch-all viewer route that resolves slash-containing certificate numbers (e.g. `ODE/CERT/2026/00101`) or UUID tokens and renders `CertificateViewer`.
- **`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/certificates/page.tsx`**  
  Back-office certificate registry for administrators, field officers, and citizens to view issued certificates, download documents, and filter records.
- **`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/certificate/[id]/page.tsx`**  
  Internal dashboard viewer for single certificate records.
- **`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/certificate/permit/[id]/page.tsx`**  
  Internal dashboard viewer for trade permits and business licenses.

---

### H. Data Models & API Services
- **`src/types/certificate.ts`**  
  Type definitions for the backend API certificate schema (`BackendCertificate`, `ServiceDetails`, etc.).
- **`src/types/publicCertificate.ts`**  
  Type definitions for the presentation model (`PublicCertificate`) consumed by `CertificateRenderer`.
- **`src/services/apiCertificates.ts`**  
  Consumes `/api/v1/certificates` and `/api/v1/certificates/:id` and maps backend responses to presentation models via `transformBackendToPublicCertificate`.
- **`src/services/apiPublicCertificate.ts`**  
  Resolves certificates across multiple tiers: backend API, seeded offline registry, and local browser cache.
- **`src/services/apiVerification.ts`**  
  Verification service resolving queries across certificate numbers, verification codes, and permit tokens.
- **`src/lib/certificateTokens.ts`**  
  Token generation utilities, date formatting, and public URL construction (`getPublicCertificateUrl`).
